### Hyper Geant

------

This project is written for the virtual machine pico-8, for my own entertainment.

To build for web: `export hypergeant.html` when the project is open in pico-8. We're not actually going to use the exported html; we just need the JS part.

The web implementation uses the (incredibly useful) PICO-8 GPIO listener library from here: https://github.com/benwiley4000/pico8-gpio-listener
