### Hyper Geant

------

This project is written for the virtual machine pico-8, for my own entertainment.

It uses Flask to support daily courses (not really necessary) and leaderboards.

To build for web: `pico8 -export flaskr/static/hypergeant.js p8/hypergeant.p8`

The web implementation uses the (incredibly useful) PICO-8 GPIO listener library from here: https://github.com/benwiley4000/pico8-gpio-listener
